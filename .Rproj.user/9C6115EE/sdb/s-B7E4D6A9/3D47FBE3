A competitive bonus on top of an individual bonus, or an 'all or nothing' competitive bonus? \n- How are the effects of competition on risk taking moderated by the risk--reward relationship in the environment?\n\n# 6 Experimental conditions\n\n- We can create 6 conditions by comparing which information is given (individual or social), and the reward structure (individual, individual + competitive, competitive only):\n\n\n```{r out.width = \"100%\", echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../media/conditiondiagram.png\")\n```\n\n<!-- |*Information Condition* | Individual Reward (r.I)| Individual Reward + Competition Bonus (r.IC) | Competition Bonus Only (r.C)| -->\n<!-- |:----------------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:| -->\n<!-- |     Individual information (i.I)|    1|2     |3    | -->\n<!-- |     Individual + Social information (i.IS)|    4|5     |6    | -->\n\n<!-- Table: 6 Experimental conditions -->\n\n### Reward conditions\n\nThe reward conditions dictate how a player's performance, and possibily the performance of a competitor, contributes to a final monetary bonus. Consider a task that results in points, where each point is worth \\$0.01. Two players A and B complete the task and player A earns 150 points, while player B earns 200 points.\n\n||Condition | Description | Player A'a | Player B \n|--:|:---------------|:-------------------------|:-----|:-----------|\n|r.I|     Individual only| Earnings depend only on individual performance |150p |200p    | \n|r.IC|     Individual + Competition Bonus| Earnings depend on individual performance plus a bonus if you outperform your competitor |  150p| 200p + **100p** = 300p    |\n|r.C|     Competition Bonus only| Earnings only depend on your performance relative to your competitor. If you lose, you win nothing. |  0p|**100p**     |\n\n### Information conditions\n\nThe information condition dictates whether players receive some sort of feedback on their competitor's performance during the task.\n\n\n||Condition | Description |\n|--:|:---------------|:--------------------------------------|\n|i.I|     Individual only (I)| Individuals only know their performance throughout the game. In the competitive reward conditions, they only learn how their competitor did at the end | \n|i.IS|     Individual + Social (IS)| Individuals know both their performance and that of others over time|  \n\n- In the i.IS condition, the rate at which individuals receive information about others' performance is a free parameter (e.g.; after every trial? every X trials?)\n\n# Tasks\n\n|Paradigm                  |Description | Versions | Learning?        | Uncertainty?\n|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:--------------|:-------------|:----|\n|Holt and Laury (Holt & Laury, 2002)|Repeated selections between 10 paired lottery choices.|-|No |No|\n|Standard DFD gambles (boxes, pie charts) |Repeated selections between gambles varying in risk and EV. |-| No | No|\n|Columbia Card Task (Figner et al., 2009)        |Select cards until they decide to stop, or they select the joker.|1) Hot: Sequential <br>2) Cold: Simultaneous| Yes|No|\n|BART (Lejuez et al., 2002)|Pump a balloon until they cash out, or the balloon pops|1) Hot: Sequential<br>2) Cold: Simultaneous|Yes |Yes|\n\n# Environments\n\nWhat statistical environments should people play in? I can consider three domains that vary in the relationship between risk and reward.\n\n\n|Domain |Example | Description | Question |\n|:---------|:------|:------------------------|:-----------------------------|\n|Risk favorable|Stock Market.| Positive risk-reward correlation (e.g.; risky options have higher EV)| In environments with a positive risk-reward correlation, can competition cause people to become more risky, and thus earn more at both the individual and group level?|\n|Risk Neutral |?|No risk-reward correlation (all options have same EV)|In environments with no risk-reward correlation, does competition still increase risk?| \n|Risk unfavorable|Smoking. Risky sex  |Negative risk-reward correlation (risky options have lower-EV)|In environments with a negative risk-reward correlation, does compeititon cause people to become more risky, and earn less, or do they become less risky, and earn more??| \n\n# Study Proposals\n\n1. DFD. 20 repeated choices between 2 (binary) gambles. One high risk, one low risk\n    - 2: Information Conditions\n        - Individual (i.I)\n        - Social (i.S)\n    - 3: Reward Conditions\n        - Individual (r.I)\n        - Individual + Competition (r.IC)\n        - Competition only (r.C)\n    - 3: Environments\n        - Risk Favorable: A (EV = +1.5, VAR = 5), B (EV = +2.0, VAR = 10),\n        - Risk Neutral: A (EV = +1.5, VAR = 7.5), B (EV = +1.5, VAR = 10),\n        - Risk Unfravorable: A (EV = +1.5, VAR = 7.5), B (EV = +1.0, VAR = 10)\n    - Social information\n        - Every 5 choices, players receive social information (3 times)\n        \n2. BART. 40 repeated plays of the BART with a maximum popping value of 10.\n    - 2: Information Conditions\n        - Individual (i.I)\n        - Social (i.S)\n    - 3: Reward Conditions\n        - Individual (r.I)\n        - Individual + Competition (r.IC)\n        - Competition only (r.C)\n    - 2: Environment\n        - Risk favorable: Balloons more likely to pop at large values.\n        - Risk \"neutral\": Balloons equally likely to pop anywhere.\n    - Social information\n        - Every 10 balloons, players receive social information (3 times)\n\n\n\n",
