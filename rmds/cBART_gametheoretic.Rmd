## Task

- Two players are playing a competitive version of the BART (cBART), where each balloon is equally likely to burst anywhere from 1 to 10 pumps.
- Players play $N$ balloons. Whichever player has the most points after $N$ balloons wins an all-or-nothing bonus. If players tie, then one is randomly determined to win.
- For example, consider two players x and y playing a game with $N = 5$ balloons. Here are their point earnings across all 5 balloons:

| Balloon | Player x: $x_{p} = 2$| Player y: $y_{p} = 5$|
|:---|:---|:---|
|1 | 0 | 5|
|2 | 2 | 0|
|3 | 2 | 0|
|4 | 2 | 5|
|5 | 0 | 5|
|**Total**|**6** | **15**|

- Here, player x always pumps 2 times, while player y always pumps 5 times.
- Because player y earned more points across all $N = 5$ balloons than player x, player y wins a (large) bonus while player x earns nothing.

## Questions

- How should an optimal player adjust their pumping strategy (aka, risk level) when playing against a competitor with either a known, or unknown strategy?
- How does the optimal risk strategy change as a function of the number of games that are played?

## Conclusions

- When the number of balloons is low (i.e.; $N = 1$), then the best response depends on one's expectations of their opponent.
    - If you believe that your opponent will pump 1 time, you should pump 2 times -- if you expect he will pump 2 times you should pump 3 times. This continues until your expect your opponent to pump 5 times or more. In these cases, you should only pump once. This is because when an opponent pumps say 7 times, then it's better to pump once and hope that his pops.

- As the number of balloons increases, then the best response becomes closer to 5, *regardless* of how much you expect your opponent to pump.
    - For example, if you play $N = 100$ balloons, then you should always pump 5 times. The reason for this is that, if one plays infinitely many balloons, then one should simply try to maximize their expected rewards, regardless of the other player's strategy.

- It is (almost) never optimal to pump more than 50\% of the time (i.e.; 5 out of 10 is the maximum).

- These results suggest that the *time horizon* (i.e. number of game opportunities) matters when deciding how to adjust your risk in a competitive task. In a game with a very short time horizon (i.e. $N = 1$), then only pumping a few times can be optimal given certain expectations of one's opponent. However, in games with very long time horizons (i.e., $N = 100$, then it is almost always optimal to use an individual payoff maximization strategy.)


### Definitions

| Parameter| Definition|
|:---|:---|
|     $N$|    Total number of ballooons|
|     $max$ | Maximum number of pumps per balloon |
|     $x_{p}$|    Pumps by player x|
|     $y_{p}$|    Pumps by player y|


- Each balloon is equally likely to pop anywhere from 1 to $max$.
- If a balloon pops, the player earns no points. If the balloon does not pop, the player earns $p$ points, where $p$ is the number of pumps he made.
- Whichever player has the most points after $N$ balloons wins an all-or-nothing bonus. If players tie, one is randomly determined to be the winner. 

### Formulas

- A player's earnings on each balloon is $x_{p}$ with probability $1 - \frac{x_{p}}{max}$, or $0$ with probability $\frac{x_{p}}{max}$
    - For example, given a balloon with a maximum of 10 pumps, a player who pumps 5 times will earn 5 with probability $1 - 5/10 = .5$, and 0 with probability $5/10$
- A player's distribution of earnings across $N$ balloons is given by a binomial distribution with $p = 1 - \frac{x_{p}}{max}$, and $N = N$, where each success has a value of $x_{p}$}

#### Ex: N = 1, max = 10, x.p = 5

For example, consider a game with $N = 1$, $max = 10$, $x_{p} = 5$. Here, the player always pumps 5 times (the optimal). There are only two possible outcomes: a 50\% chance of the balloon popping (for a reward of 0), and a 50\% chance of saving the balloon (for a reward of 5)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The distribution of reward outcomes when N = 1, max = 10, x.p = 50"}
result <- bart.pmf.fun(pumps = 5, 
                       max.pumps = 10, 
                       balloon.n = 1, 
                       plot = TRUE)

knitr::kable(result$pmf, caption = "Outcome distribution for N = 1, max = 10, x.p = 5", digits = 3)
```


#### Ex: N = 10, max = 10, x.p = 5

Now, let's increase the number of games to $N = 10$. Now there is a wider distribution of outcomes because more games are played.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
result <- bart.pmf.fun(pumps = 5, 
                       max.pumps = 10, 
                       balloon.n = 10, 
                       plot = TRUE)

knitr::kable(result$pmf, caption = "Outcome distribution for N = 10, max = 10, x.p = 5", digits = 3)
```


#### Ex: N = 10, max = 10, x.p = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

We can also perform similar calculations when a player does not have a constant pumping rate, but rather a stochastic one. Here, we use simulations instead of an arithmetic solution. 

Here are the distributions of outcomes from a player who is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times. As we will see, this player has an expected earnings of 18.29, which is less than a player who always pumps 5 times and had an expected earning of 25.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
result <- bart.pmf.fun(pumps = 1:9, 
                       max.pumps = 10, 
                       balloon.n = 10, 
                       plot = TRUE)
```

### Competition

```{r, echo = FALSE}
max.pumps <- 10

eq.df <- expand.grid(x.p = seq(1, max.pumps - 1, 1),
                      y.p = seq(1, max.pumps - 1, 1),
                      balloon.n = c(1, 2, 3, 5, 100),
                       max.pumps = max.pumps,
                       p.x.win = NA,
                       p.tie = NA,
                       p.y.win = NA)


x <- data.frame(t(sapply(1:nrow(eq.df), FUN = function(x) {
  
  result <- cbart.fun(x.p = eq.df$x.p[x],
                          y.p = eq.df$y.p[x],
                          max.pumps = eq.df$max.pumps[x],
                          balloon.n = eq.df$balloon.n[x])
  
  return(c(result$p.x.win, result$p.tie, result$p.x.lose))
  
})))

eq.df[c("p.x.win", "p.tie", "p.y.win")] <- x

# Add p(win) when ties are split between players

eq.df <- eq.df %>% mutate(
  p.y.win.nt = p.y.win + p.tie / 2,
  p.x.win.nt = p.x.win + p.tie / 2
)

```

Now, we calculate the probability of winning a game given two players $x$ and $y$. At the start of the game, players x and y decide on their pumping values $x_{p}$, $y_{p}$. They then play $N$ balloons. Players are not told how many points the other player earns over the course of the game (e.g.; as sequential balloons are played). When the game is finished, and all $N$ balloons are completed, the player with the most points across all balloons wins an all-or-nothing bonus while the other player earns nothing.

We can calculate the probability that a player wins after $N$ balloons by comparing each player's earning distributions after $N$ balloons. For example, consider a player x who pumps 5 times ($x_{p} = 5$) and a player y who pumps 8 times ($y_{p} = 8$) playing $N = 10$ balloons. Here are their expected earnings:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, results = "hide"}
bart.pmf.fun(pumps = 5, max.pumps = 10, balloon.n = 10, plot = TRUE, ylim = c(0, .5), col = "red")
bart.pmf.fun(pumps = 8, max.pumps = 10, balloon.n = 10, plot = TRUE, add = TRUE, col = "gray")
legend("topright", legend = c("x.p = 5", "y.p = 8"), col = c("red", "gray"), lty = 1, lwd = 3)

legend("topleft", "p(x wins) = 76%", bty= "n")

# Calculate win probabilities
cbart.fun(5, 8, 10, 10)
```

We can calculate the probability that x wins by comparing the two distributions directly (ie.; what is the summed probability of all outcomes where x wins?). Here, the probability that player x wins is 76%, and the probability that y wins is 24%.


Now, we calculate the probabiliy that x wins given all combinations of $x_{p}$ and $y_{p}$ for different numbers of balloons $N$.

#### Ex: N = 1, max = 10

- We'll start with a game with one balloon. That is, a one-shot game. Here, we see that a player's best response depends very much on his expectation of the other player. For example, if player y will pump just once, then player x should pump 2 times for a probability of winning of 80%. In contrast, if player y pumps 9 times, then player x should only pump 1 time for an 81% probability of winning. Finally, if player y pumps 5 times, then player y should pump just 1 time again.


- There is no Nash equilibrium in this short-horizon game as players should always adjust their strategy for every behavior of their opponent.

```{r n1hp, fig.width= 6, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Probability of player x winning a game with N = 1 balloon given each combination of x.p and y.p"}
heat.fun(p.x.win.nt ~ x.p + y.p, data = subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 1), rounding = 2, 
         main = "N = 1 Balloon\np(x Wins | x.p, y.p)", xlab = "x.p", ylab = "y.p", cex = 1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
iso.curve.fun(subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 1), main = "N = 1 Balloon")
```

- If your opponent is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times, then you should pump 2, 3 or 4 times

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
cbart.br.fun(1:9, plot = TRUE)
```

#### Ex: N = 2, max = 10

- When the number of balloons increases to 2, then the best response to a competitor with moderately high pumping values increases from 1. The biggest jump is when y.p = 5. Here, the best response is now x.p = 6.

- There is still no Nash equilibrium. Players should cycle between 4, 5 and 6 pumps.

- If your opponent is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times, then you should pump 3 or 4 times


```{r fig.width= 6, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Probability of player x winning a game with N = 2 balloons given each combination of x.p and y.p"}
heat.fun(p.x.win.nt ~ x.p + y.p, data = subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 2), rounding = 2, 
         main = "N = 2 Balloons\np(x Wins | x.p, y.p)", xlab = "x.p", ylab = "y.p", cex = 1)
```

```{r}
iso.curve.fun(subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 2), main = "N = 2 Balloons")
```

- If your opponent is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times, then you should pump 4 times

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
cbart.br.fun(1:9, plot = TRUE, balloon.n = 2)
```

#### Ex: N = 5, max = 10

- When the number of balloons increases to 5, the best response for all y.p values greater than 2 is now either 5 or 6.

- Still no equilibrium

- If your opponent is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times, then you should pump 5 times.


```{r fig.width= 6, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Probability of player x winning a game with N = 5 balloons given each combination of x.p and y.p"}
heat.fun(p.x.win.nt ~ x.p + y.p, data = subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 5), rounding = 2, 
         main = "N = 5 Balloons\np(x Wins | x.p, y.p)", xlab = "x.p", ylab = "y.p", cex = 1)
```

```{r}
iso.curve.fun(subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 5), main = "N = 5 Balloons")
```


- If your opponent is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times, then you should pump 4 or 5 times

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
cbart.br.fun(1:9, plot = TRUE, balloon.n = 5)
```

#### Ex: N = 100, max = 10

- Finally, when the number of balloons increases to 100, the best response is always 5.
- In a long-horizon game, the Nash equilibrum is the individual maxization strategy.
- If your opponent is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times, then you should pump 5 times.


```{r fig.width= 6, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Probability of player x winning a game with N = 100 balloons given each combination of x.p and y.p"}
heat.fun(p.x.win.nt ~ x.p + y.p, data = subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 100), rounding = 2, 
         main = "N = 100 Balloons\np(x Wins | x.p, y.p)", xlab = "x.p", ylab = "y.p", cex = 1)
```

```{r}
iso.curve.fun(subset(eq.df, balloon.n == 100), main = "N = 100 Balloons")
```

- If your opponent is equally likely to pump anywhere from 1 to 9 times, then you should pump 4 or 5 times

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
cbart.br.fun(1:9, plot = TRUE, balloon.n = 100)
```
